^XX = xor current register with XX
> = next
+XX = add XX to current register
-XX = subtract XX from current register
*XX = multiply current register by XX
/XX = divide current register by XX
#YY = set current character of register X (specified by `.X`) to YY
$XYY = initialize register X and set it to YY ([] for array, you can optionally have a 2-digit hexadecemal number in the brackets if you want a specific length)
:X{} = loop through X
.X = set the current register to X
_X = log register X
@{} = if current_item is more then 0, run the expression in brackets
" " = (it's just a space) literally nothing
! = turn the current number into a bit, then flip it
~X = overwrite current register with user input (question: register X)
